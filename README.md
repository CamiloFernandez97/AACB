🧩 Initial App Structure (MVP)

🐻 Welcome Screen with Bärchen

Bärchen greets you in both German and Spanish.

He explains that we're not just going to memorize words, but truly understand how the language works.

📚 Lesson 1: The Basic Word Order in a Sentence

Goal: Build your first complete sentence in German.

Example: "Ich bin Camilo" → subject + verb + complement.

Bärchen explains with a friendly voice while animated (e.g., munching on a pretzel between phrases!).

🎮 Interactive Practice

The user drags components: subject, verb, complement.

Bärchen gives humorous corrections if the sentence is incorrect.

Upon correct answers: animation + small reward (“1 pretzel!”).

🧠 Logic Before Vocabulary

Only the necessary vocabulary is introduced to practice structures.

Instead of word lists, Bärchen asks questions like:
“What happens if I move the verb to the end?” → Begins to introduce subordinate clause structure.
