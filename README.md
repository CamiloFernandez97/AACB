Initial App Structure (MVP)

Welcome Screen with Bärchen

Bärchen greets you in both German and Spanish.

He explains that we're not just going to memorize words, but truly understand how the language works.

Lesson 1: The Basic Word Order in a Sentence

Goal: Build your first complete sentence in German.

Example: "Ich bin Camilo" → subject + verb + complement.

Bärchen explains with a friendly voice while animated (e.g., munching on a pretzel between phrases!).

Interactive Practice

The user drags components: subject, verb, complement.

Bärchen gives humorous corrections if the sentence is incorrect.

Upon correct answers: animation + small reward (“1 pretzel!”).

Logic Before Vocabulary

Only the necessary vocabulary is introduced to practice structures.

Instead of word lists, Bärchen asks questions like:
“What happens if I move the verb to the end?” → Begins to introduce subordinate clause structure.

Structural Lessons

Lesson 3: The verbs sein and haben.
